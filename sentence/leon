何工你好！
As discussed this morning, your choice of making a separate 企业微信 group to collect After-Sales Dept feedback should make things easier for us. Maybe we can do the same with Marketing Dept to see what can be improved in the APP UI?
As the Project Architect, most of the pressure is lying onto you and I shoulders. But, as 皮总 reminded 所有中心经理 last week, other involved Depts also have their respective duties in this project. To this regards, success or failure doesnt depend only on you and I. 
Week-ends are necessary to release the work pressure and spend happy times in family. Sometimes, I also feel I should work during week-ends, to support my Company, my Boss and my Colleagues. Sometimes, I just dont. This is a personal decision. I mean, we work on week-end only if we really enjoy, not because we feel external pressure.
A few years ago, I used to work during week-ends, and the result was: I was exhausted on monday morning, I could not achieve efficient results in my work, and I hardly saw my wife and kids. Fantastic result... Just my experience.
As 皮总 wrote last week, this project is a long term project. You achieved a lot since you joined SID. Not everybody can see it yet, but me, I see it. Though I am not an expert in your field, I am confident that you made the best available technical choices.
I will do my best to improve our coordination with other Depts.

Roles: I added English in my reply before lunch: could you keep English besides Chinese in your updated file?
